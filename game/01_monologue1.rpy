    I'm racing towards the park, 
    barely able to stay focused enough to dodge out of people's way.

    I've been repressing a massive wave of anxiety since I got that phone call.

    Whatever Dave has done to injure himself this time,

    with all the scrapes he gets into.

    I finally spot him and rush over.
